### Program Description:
This basic Python program aims to emulate a customer ordering system for a "make-your-own" ice cream sundae bar. The program first requires that the user select an ice cream flavour from the list provided and enter the number of scoops that they would like. The program then prompts the user to optionally add a sauce and various toppings to their creation. Finally, the program prints the order details, including the total price, to the user's screen.

### Included files:
- *project.py* contains the program's source code.
- *test_project.py* contains unit tests for several of the program's functions/methods
- *requirements.txt* lists all third-party modules required to run the program.
